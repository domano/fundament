# Troubleshooting

## SwiftPM manifest or cache permission errors

- Ensure SwiftPM has write access; the Makefile already disables the sandbox and redirects caches under the repo.  
- If the build still fails, run `rm -rf .swift-module-cache .swift-build-cache` and retry `make swift`.

## Missing `FoundationModels` / availability failures

- The shim checks `SystemLanguageModel` availability; on unsupported hardware or macOS versions < 26 it returns a structured error.  
- Verify the machine is Apple Intelligenceâ€“eligible and logged into the correct Apple ID with the entitlement enabled.

## Go linker cannot find `libFundamentShim.dylib`

- Confirm you ran `make swift` before `go build`.  
- The cgo linker flags include `-Wl,-rpath`; if binaries are executed from another directory, set `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` manually.

## Structured generation inaccuracies

- The JSON schema translator currently supports objects, arrays, enums (`anyOf` strings), and primitive string/int/bool types.  
- Complex schema features (references, numeric guides) are not yet implemented. Update both the Go schema builder and `buildDynamicSchema` if you need more coverage.  
- See [Decision: Schema Support](../../decisions/notes/schema_support.md) for details.

## Streaming delivers whole sentences

- The shim collects the stream and splits on spaces before invoking the callback.  
- To provide real-time token snapshots, the stream bridging code must be extended to forward partial snapshots instead of aggregating them.  
- Track this work in the interop layer; see [Architecture](../../product/design/architecture.md).
