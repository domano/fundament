# Decision Log

Historical context that influences current behaviour:

- [Availability Enforcement](notes/availability.md) — why the project targets macOS 26 and how that surfaces in the API.  
- [Schema Translation Strategy](notes/schema_support.md) — scope and limitations of the JSON schema bridge.

Consult these notes before altering build targets, availability checks, or structured generation features.
