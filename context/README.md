# Context Directory

This folder captures the key knowledge an agent needs to understand the **fundament** project.  
It is organised into three tiers:

1. **Product** — the vision, API surface, and architectural choices.  
2. **Operations** — how to build, test, and troubleshoot the toolchain.  
3. **Decisions** — historical context and constraints that affect future changes.

Use the links below to navigate:

- [Product Overview](product/README.md)
- [Operational Notes](operations/README.md)
- [Decision Log](decisions/README.md)

Agents should skim the top level for orientation, then dive deeper as needed via the linked sub-pages. Each tier drills down into focused Markdown files in the third level of the directory hierarchy.
